    "Hello, and welcome to the **Cuisenaire-Gattegno Notebook**. This Notebook is based on iHaskell Notebook. It provides an interface similar to an interactive shell along the lines of GHCi. However, it is much more powerful than GHCi, and provides features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, multi-line input cells, integrated documentation, rich output visualization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we report on seven one hour lessons adapted from teaching Haskell in Years 6 and 7 as part of the primary computer science school curriculum. The Disciplinary Concept Graph above shows the plan for these units. It shows how the concepts covered here are related to one another. \n",

    "> We'll be using things from day one, without fully understanding their meaning, thus constantly incurring a conceptual debt. Some of this debt will be paid later. Some of it will stay with us forever. The alternative would be to first learn about cartesian closed categories and domain theory, formally define simply typed lambda calculus, build its categorical model, and only then wave our hands a bit and claim that at its core Haskell approximates this model (Programming with Categories, DRAFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "iHaskell is implemented as a language kernel for the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) project, which means that although the entire thing is written only in Haskell, we get a beautiful notebook interface practically for free.\n",

    "We can start with very simple observations about the Cuisenaire rods that follow from free play with the box of rods, and exercises chosen by the teacher taken from the first four chapters of [Book 1](https://issuu.com/eswi/docs/gattegno-math-textbook-1) (This link may be temporarily offline). An online environment for exploring the rods is [here](https://nrich.maths.org/4348).\n",
