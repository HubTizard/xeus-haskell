    "Caleb Gattegno wrote (What we owe,1970, p23) that _\"We teach a child to learn to say, '2 apples plus 3 apples make 5 apples.' '2 pens plus 3 pens make 5 pens.' What has he proved to us in learning this? That he knows that 2,3 and 5 are three operators that go together, that 2 and 3 can be passed from apples to pens to pears to chairs and so forth. This is an important accomplishment. But teachers say children have to know that 2 plus 3 is 5. What do they mean? They mean that 2 apples and 3 apples is concrete, that 2 pens and 3 pens is also concrete and that such a concreteness does not give children a proper grasp of the abstract concept of 2 and 3 and 5 and the relationship 2 plus 3.

    "## Afterword\n",
    "\n",
    "In  Gattegno's The Computer and the Mind (1981) he addresses the role of computer technology in educational process design. He suggests that fruitful comparison between computers and human faculties must be drawn with the _mind_ rather than the _brain_; explores software as an objectification of certain mental operations; argues for an emerging universe of `nothings`---minute energetic shifts that underwrite both cognition and computation; and derives practical, awareness-first consequences for pedagogy. His emphasis is on awareness, knowledge integration, and the computer as an amplifier of mental presence rather than as a repository of memory or a drill engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dilemma: mind--brain\n",
    "Gattegno opens by reframing the question that popularised comparison of computation and biology: not brain versus computer, but mind versus computer. The reason is methodological. The mind is uniquely self-referential: it is capable of knowing itself and of knowing its creations (language, tools, models, computers). Notwithstanding the tendency to anthropomorphise software neither brains nor computers---considered as tissues or circuits---possess this reflexive capacity (Benson, Machines That Mimic Thought, 1971). The appropriate locus for a conversation about computers is thus the mind in dialogue with its own objectifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gattegno extends the the classical partitions (Greek _soma--psyche--nous_ and the more common Roman _body--mind_ with a proposed hierarchy in which the _self_, as energy, remains at the peak; it objectifies (1) soma, through embryogenesis and integration of bodily systems; (2) psyche, as guardianship of automatisms that free attention for novelty; and (3) mind, as the locus of perception, action, feeling, and thought. The brain's tissue is maintained by the psyche; its functionings are taught by the mind. Awareness is the catalytic key that lets mental acts observe, adjust, and transform themselves. The `mind--brain problem` is thereby recast as a question about how self-energised awareness educates a biological substrate to sustain increasingly subtle, integrated, and transcendent operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond programming: the universe of `nothings`\n",
    "What lies beyond competence in coding is a transformation of _mental presence_. Computers react with negligible inertia and ruthless exactness to minuscule deviations; this trains alertness, precision, and a sustained `now`---a felt sense of several co-present projects, constraints, and levels of description actively cooperating. The practitioner experiences the mind's dynamics more acutely than in writing or painting because many dialogues (aim, logic, interface, feedback) synchronise in tight loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experience invites a shift in ontology. The computer popularises attention to _very small_ energetic differences---`nothings`---that make a difference: subthreshold changes that nevertheless steer the course of thinking and computing. By analogy, cognition operates through minute energetic organisations whose effects are spectacular when well-integrated (as molecules do relative to atoms). Mental acts move faster than light in their combinatorial reach because they are not spatial translations but reorganisations of `relations`---again, shifts among `nothings.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition, in this framework, is the mind's continuous synthesis that holds the whole while focusing on a detail, never losing contact with the total energetic field. The computer, precisely because it is unforgiving and nearly massless in response, becomes a laboratory for intuition: it rewards criteria that are crisp, compositional, and exactly sufficient; it punishes vagueness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus an epistemology of creation emerges: vision, essential dynamics, and constraint-awareness generate criteria; criteria filter hypotheses; filtered hypotheses catalyse new insights; insights are objectified as programs or generative AI prompts; programs alter both machine use and human comprehension."
